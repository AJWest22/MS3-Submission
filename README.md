## **Overview**
 - This site was created for MS3 submission for Code Institute.
 - The site's name is Book Recommendations.
 - The source code can be found on GitHub
 - The site is deployed using Heroku

 - The purpose of this site is to help people find books they might like to read in a particular genre, and leave 
   recommendations on books they have read and would recommend. Users can browse the site and read the books in the dropdown menu
   recommendations, but must be logged in to add a review, edit, and delete a review. 

 - There are currently two types of accounts at the moment:

     **Username**: Reader **Password**: Reader
    and 

    **Username**: Admin **Password** Admin
    Both accounts are test accounts used to test site functionality, for example: Reader was used to check if accounts were showing on the Database, and Admin was used to check if only reviews added by admin could be edited by admin.
